Listed below are the changes that we have made since our previous submission on
April 23rd, 2024.

Comments and Styling:
    - Each file was checked and corrected for any styling mistakes, such undescriptive varaible names
      and methods, as well as adding more comments were needed and ensuring comments in cpp files
      followed the correct styling as well.


UI and Bug Fixes:
    - There was a small bug in level 5, causing it to incorrectly tell the user they had solved the
      circuit. This was not found till after the first submission and has now been fixed.
    - Minor UI changes were made when it comes to ensuring the preset circuit and user dragged gates
      lined up correctly. Further changes were made to make the lines transitioning from circuit to
      gate more smoother and visually appealing.



Pop Window:
    - Updated final pop window after completion of all levels to give user more options on starting over
      or returning to main window. Updated message to let user know they had gone through all levels.

    - Updated all training pop up windows to display correct information about each gate, as well as fixed any
      grammatical errors they possessed.

Main Menu:
    - Updated the help menu to provide the user more information on gates, bits, and bitwise logic. Fixed any
      grammatical errors found.

    - We had tried to implment an electricity effect in the main menu to make it more visually dynamic, but were
      not able to get it working properly by the last submission. We were able to get this correctly implemented
      after the submision and have added the neccessary class to display this in the main menu.


Repo Cleanup:
    - Removed old images that are no longer being used from the repo.
